<h3>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)</h3>
<p>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest hits hard with its intense story and unforgettable characters. Jack Nicholson totally owns the role of McMurphy. Definitely brings tears by the end of the movie. </p>

<h3>Jurassic Park (1993)</h3>
<p>Jurassic Park blew my mind with its groundbreaking special effects that brought dinosaurs to life like never before. The thrilling adventure and the idea of humans interacting with these ancient creatures kept me on the edge of my seat. Instantly made dinosaurs a huge part of my life.</p>

<h3>Toy Story (1995)</h3>
<p>Toy Story is a classic because it perfectly blends heartwarming moments with humor and nostalgia. The characters are very memorable & loved. Plus, itâ€™s got that great mix of clever storytelling and feels that make you look at your own toys in a whole new way.</p>
